Crit has 3 important aspects

- Extensive scoring system
- Identifying opportunities
- Prioritizing your vision 

## 1\. Extensive scoring system

What if you could pin-point exactly where and how to improve your design? We have a created a scoring system to break down designs and measure the impact numerically. Each scoring metric is further broken down into what matters to achieve the metric, while also taking into the account how different industries value different outcomes. 

Dive deeper into [how the scores are calculated](https://1000x.mintlify.app/crit/design-score/overview).

## 2\. Identifying opportunities

More than numbers, Crit also provides actionable recommendations by identifying and prioritizing the opportunities that best address your business goals and user needs. Each opportunity is backed by high-value, vetted data set and based on the best practices of the deisgn industry. The aim is to provide instant actions to make your product more impactful.

## 3\. Prioritizing your vision

We don't focus on providing the perfect analysis, we focus on providing the most personalized design analysis. In order to achieve that, we put the business goals and user needs first. That's why we have meticulously added a check to ensure high-value feedback is provided.
