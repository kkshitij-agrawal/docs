**The Crit scoring system is a comprehensive evaluation framework** designed to assess any design across multiple dimensions.

<Note>
  Currently scoped down to only analyse hero section of landing pages. We'll be launching the full version very soon.
</Note>

The design is analyzed across four key dimensions:

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Standards" icon="bullseye" href="standards">
    Does it follow accessibility rules? Does it have a proper grid system? Any nit-picked suggestions which may improve your design.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clarity" icon="triangle" href="clarity">
    How clear is your website to your users? Can they immediately understand what you offer and what your brand values are?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conversion" icon="arrow-trend-up" href="conversion">
    How well does your design convert your users? How effective are the call-to-action buttons on your website?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design" icon="object-ungroup" href="design">
    How user friendly and polished is your design? Does it align with how humans think and act? Is there a break in the user's flow?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The scoring system balances both objective analysis with subjective assessments of user experience, conversion optimization, and design quality. Each dimension is further broken down into specific components weighted according to their relative importance.

## Different industry, different weightage

We adapt the scoring weightage based on your specific industry, recognizing that certain dimensions may be more relevant to your design objectives than others. For instance, healthcare industries value trust more than conversion, where as e-commerce websites value conversion more than how polished the design looks. It's about finding the balance that suits you and your goals.

## AI is not perfect

We don't focus on providing the perfect analysis, we focus on providing the most personalized design analysis. In order to achieve that, we put the business goals and user needs first. That's why we have meticulously added a check to ensure high-value feedback is provided.
