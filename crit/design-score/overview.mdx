The Crit scoring system is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess any design across multiple dimensions.

Currenlty limited to the hero section of landing pages, the design is analyzed across four key dimensions:

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Standards" icon="bullseye"href="standards">
    Does it follow accessibility rules?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clarity" icon="triangle" href="clarity">
    How clear is your website to your users?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conversion" icon="arrow-trend-up" href="conversion">
    How well does your design convert users?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design" icon="object-ungroup" href="design">
    How user friendly and polished is your design?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The system balances objective technical criteria with subjective assessments of user experience, conversion optimization, and design quality. Each dimension is further broken down into specific components weighted according to their relative importance.
