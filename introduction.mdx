Everyone thinks design is about making things look pretty. That's like saying cooking is just about plating. When a great product designer looks at a problem, their brain is running three tracks simultaneously:

- Do people actually want this? (processing user behaviour)
- Will this make money? (thinking about business growth)
- How should this work? (applying design patterns)

“Design intelligence” is analyzing these three line of thoughts to make product decisions that work. It's about knowing which problems are worth solving, what users say vs what they actually do, and when to steal vs when to innovate.

  Design intelligence is the how a designer's brain works.
